Bebumblia Communications
--------- --------------

The perfectly flat planet of beebumblia is occupied by
two warrior races, the bees and the beebears.  They are
fighting a war, of course.

The bees are having trouble with their communications,
and need your computational assistance.

Bee communications are done solely by bee drones, who
only fly in perfectly straight lines between bee army
command hives.  Unfortunately, if a bee drone flies over
any part of a beebear army, it will be instantly eaten.

You have been asked to compute whether or not a drone
can be used to communication between two particular bee
command hives.  The good news is that bee command hives
are very small, and beebear armies are almost perfect
circles, so for computational purposes bee command hives
may be taken as points and beebear armies as circles.

Input
-----

For each of a number of data sets:

Line 1: The number N of beebear armies, followed by
        N triples of numbers, one for each army.  Each
	triple consists of an X coordinate, a Y coordi-
	nate, and a diameter, in order.  1 <= N <= 10.

Line 2: Two pairs of numbers, one pair for each bee
	command hive.  Each pair consists of an X coor-
	dinate followed by a Y coordinate.

The input ends with a line containing a single 0.


Output:
------

One line for each data set.  The line begins with
`Data Set #:' and ends with either `OK' or `EATEN'.
