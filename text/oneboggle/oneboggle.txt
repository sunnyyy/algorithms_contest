One-Boggle
----------

One-Boggle is a game in which you are given a line full
of random letters and you are asked to find as many
words in the line as possible.  In our version, you are
also given a dictionary containing all the words you are
allowed to find.

Found words may go from left to right or right to left.
Words may overlap.  A dictionary word may appear more
than once.


Input
-----

For each of several test cases:

  * A single line giving the test case name

  * Up to 1000 lines, each containing a single diction-
    ary word.

  * A single line containing just `*'.

  * Many boggle lines, each containing random letters.

  * A single line containing just `*'.

All letters are lower case.  Words only contain letters.
No line (or word) is longer than 80 characters.

Input lines are read from the standard input.  Input
ends when an end of file is read.


Output
------

For each test case, first an exact copy of the test case
name input line, and then a copy of each boggle line
with letters that are not part of a word replaced by
periods `.'.

Output lines are printed to the standard output.  Output
ends when the program terminates.

Actual boggle differs from One-Boggle in that (1) the
game board is a 4x4 or 5x5 square, (2) words may run
from any square to any of the 8 adjacent squares, (3)
the human player can use any word they know, (4) the
the player has a time limit.
