Substrings
----------

You work for a new group doing DNA analysis, and have
been asked to write a program that will accept a DNA
string D and a large number of queries of the form

    How many times does string S appear as a substring
    of D and what are the starting locations of these
    appearances?

In the long run both D and the number of queries will
be very large, but in the first version of your program
D will not be excessively large.


Input
-----

For each of several test cases, first a line containing
just the test case name, then a possibly very long line
containing the string D, then many lines each containing
a query, and then a line containing just `*'.

Each query line contains just the string S as it is in
the query above.

D and S are strings of the letters A, C, G, and T.

    1 <= length D <= 20,000
    1 <= length S <= 20,000
    1 <= sum of length S over all queries <= 200,000,000

The test case name line contains at most 80 columns.
Other lines contain at most 20,000 columns.  Input ends
with an end of file.


Output
------

For each test case, first an exact copy of the test case
name input line, and then for each query one answer line
of the form

    L M p1 p2 ... pM

where L is the length of the query input string S, M is
the number of occurrences of S in D, and p1, p2, ..., pM
are the positions of the M occurrences.  M may equal 0.
The first letter in D has position 0, the last has
position `length D - 1'.

The positions in a query answer line may be in any order
but must not contain duplicates.
