Exchanged Compare
-----------------

Often times people will mistype a word by exchanging
adjacent letters.  You are asked to write a compare
function which returns true if and only if a first word
equals a second word after zero or more pairs of non-
overlapping letters in the second word are exchanged.


Input
-----

A sequence of test cases, each a single line containing
two words.  The words are separated by spaces and tabs.
The input ends with an end of file.

The words contain only lower case letters, and no line
is longer than 80 characters.


Output
------

For each test case, one line containing `true' if the
two input words are equal after non-adjacent letter pair
exchanges, and `false' otherwise.



Example Input
------- -----

hello hello
hello helol
hello heoll
hello ehllo
hello ehlol
hello hleol
hello helo


Example Output
------- ------

true
true
false
true
true
true
false
