Vigenere Cipher
-------- ------

A Vigenere Cipher encrypts by shifting each letter of
a plain text line cyclically to the right within the
alphabet by an amount determined by a key.  For example,
`C' is `A' shifted right 2 places and `B' is `Z' shifted
right 2 places cyclically (i.e., with wrap-around).

The key is made by repeating a keyword indefinitely.
The n'th letter of a plain text line is shifted
cyclically right by the same amount as the n'th letter
of the key is shifted right from the first letter A of
the alphabet.

So for example, if the keyword is CIPHER, the key is
CIPHERCIPHERCIPHER...., and the letters of a plain text
line are shifted cyclically right by the amounts:

    1st letter	 shift by 2    (C is A shifted by 2)
    2nd letter	 shift by 8    (I is A shifted by 8)
    3rd letter	 shift by 15   (P is A shifted by 15)
    4th letter	 shift by 7    (H is A shifted by 7)
    5th letter	 shift by 4    (E is A shifted by 4)
    6th letter	 shift by 17   (R is A shifted by 17)
    7th letter	 shift by 2    (C is A shifted by 2)
    8th letter	 shift by 8    (I is A shifted by 8)
    9th letter	 shift by 15   (P is A shifted by 15)
   10th letter	 shift by 7    (H is A shifted by 7)
   ...........  ..........    .....................

Thus for example, the line

     This is encrypted by a Vigenere Cipher.

is encrypted using the keyword `CIPHER' to

   Vpxz zu tugiaxilh dg h Mkotuiig Rptygz.

because

	T --> V  (shift by 2)
	h --> p  (shift by 8)
	i --> x  (shift by 15)
	s --> z  (shift by 7)
	  -->    (shift by 4 not used for space)
	  i --> z  (shift by 17)
	  s --> u  (shift by 2)
	    -->    (shift by 8 not used for space)
	    e --> t  (shift by 15)
	    n --> u  (shift by 7)
	    c --> g  (shift by 4)
	    r --> i  (shift by 17 AND WRAP AROUND)
	    etc.

 
Your spies have discovered an encrypted message, and
also the decrypted plain text of the first line of the
message.  They also have discovered that the message
lines were all encrypted using a Vigenere Cipher with
the same keyword, and that keyword has at most 10
letters.  You are to find the decrypted message.


Input
-----

For each of several test cases, a line containing just
the test case name, followed by the decrypted first
line of the message, followed by the encrypted message
which has one or more lines, followed by a line contain-
ing just `*'.

No line is longer than 80 characters and the message
has at most 40 lines.

Input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

For each test case, first an exact copy of the test case
name line, then the decrypted message, and lastly a line
containing just `*'.

The decrypted message is an exact copy of the encrypted
message but with letters changed.  Punctuation, spaces,
and line breaks are NOT changed.  The case of letters is
preserved (upper case to upper case, lower case to lower
case).

Test cases will be such that decryption is always
possible and is unique.
