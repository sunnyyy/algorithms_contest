The Child's Cipher
--- ------- ------

As a child, I would often encrypt my journal using a
simple substitution cipher.  In this cipher, vowels
(a,e,i,o,u,y) would be replaced with the next vowel, and
consonants would be replaced with the next consonant.
This way, words still looked more or less like words.
For instance, the word

cat

was encrypted as

dev

The vowel y is replaced with the vowel a, and the con-
sonant z is replaced with the consonant b.

The encryption and decryption is simple enough to be
done in your head as you write.

But as I age, I find this more difficult, so I am asking
you to write a computer program that automates the
process.

Input will be a set of text.  Output should be the
encrypted text.  All case, punctuation, and numbers,
spaces, and anything else in the input file that is not
a letter should be preserved.

For instance, the input

*  Kids born on days near Easter are programming aces.
<END>

should generate the output

*  Loft cusp up feat pies Ietvis esi qsuhsennoph edit.
<IPF>
