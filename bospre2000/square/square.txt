Bisecting a Square
--------- - ------

You are given a point A on or within the unit square
bordered by (0,0), (0,1), (1, 0), and (1,1), and a point
B on the boundary of that square.  Find another point C
on the boundary of the square such that the polyline BAC
bisects the area of the square.

Note that A may lie on the square boundary, and that
either B or C may be the same point as A.  However, if
A and C may be the same point, C will not be unique, and
we choose to forbid input for which C is not unique.

There will be multiple data sets of input.  Each data
set will consist of a single line containing four num-
bers separated by spaces.  The first two numbers are the
x and y coordinates of point A, and the second two num-
bers are the x and y coordinates of point B.  All num-
bers will be given in floating point.

Note that for points B and C, either x or y will be
either 0.0 or 1.0 exactly.

Your output should be, for each data set, the x and y
coordinates of point C, accurate to at least + or -
0.0001, separated by a space on a single line.
