Demographic Transition
----------------------

Almost all countries have undergone or are undergoing a
`demographic transition' in which the population
explodes because improved public health measures and
medicine cause the death rate to plummet but the birth
rate remains high for a time before dropping to match
the death rate.  You have been asked to compute the
approximate start and stop years of a country's demo-
graphic transition, and the multiplier of the transi-
tion, which is defined as the population at the stop
year divided by the population at the start year.

To compute the start and stop years, take the yearly
growth averaged over every 10 year period, define
periods with average growth of at least 1% as `high
growth', take the first year of the first high growth
period as the start year and the LAST(!!) year of the
last high growth period as the stop year.

A country can have only one demographic transition (at
least in historic times) which begins when improved
public health measures and medicine cause the death rate
to go down.  But not all periods within a demographic
transition are high growth, and in fact, population may
decrease within the transition period due to famine or
war.

To be a bit more precise, if PA is the population for
year YA, the first of the 10 year period, and PB the
population for year YB = YA + 10, then the period is
high growth if and only if (1.01)**10 <= PB/PA.  Note
YA and YB are the endpoints of a sequence of 11 (not
10) year/population pair values, and YB is the LAST
year of the high growth period.

However, it is uncertain whether 10 years is the right
period duration and whether 1% is the right growth level
for defining `high growth periods', so these need to be
parameters that can be changed.


Input 
-----

For each of several test cases, first a line containing
just the test case name (which typically is the country
name), and then one line containing the raw data and
having the format

       Y N P1 P2 P3 ... PN

This specifies the populations P1, ..., PN for N years
beginning with year Y (thus the last year is Y + N - 1).
This line is followed by one or more lines of the form

     G D

where a high growth period is defined as a period of
duration D consecutive years with effective yearly
growth G %.  The lines of this last format are followed
by a line containing just the character `*'.

To be precise, if P[YA] denotes the population at year
YA, a D year period beginning at year YA and ending at
year YA + D is high growth if and only if (1+G/100)**D
<= P[YA+D]/P[YA].

The input is such that

    0 <= Y <= Y + N - 1 <= 3,000
    2 <= N <= 3,000
    1 <= D <= N - 1
    0 <= G <= 100
    0 <= Pi <= 2,000,000 for i = 1, 2, ..., N

Populations are actual populations in units of 1,000
of the country named in the test case name line.

All input numbers are integers except G, which is
floating point.  The line containing the raw population
data may be very long, but other lines will be at most
80 characters.

Input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

For each test case, first a copy of the test case name
input line, then a line containing

      data is for years Y1 through Y2
      
where

    Y1 equals Y, the first year of raw input data
    Y2 equals Y + N - 1, the last year of raw input data

Lastly for each input line of the form

       G D

one output line of the form

    M: YA/PA through YB/PB: G% for D years

where

    M is the ratio PB / PA,
      with exactly 2 decimal places
    YA is the start year, the first year of the first
       high growth period
    PA is the population at the start year
    YB is the stop year, the last year of the last
       high growth period
    PB is the population at the stop year
    D, G are from the input line,
       but G is printed with exactly 2 decimal places

However, if there were no high growth periods, output
instead a line of the form

    no transition found: G% for D years

Note that you may get YA == Y1, which suggests that the
demographic transition actually starts before the given
data, or YB == Y2, which suggests that the transition is
not yet finished.

Tips:
----

Input consists of lines read from the standard input.
Input ends when an end-of-file is read from the standard
input.  Output consists of lines written to the standard
output.  For example input/output code see

    ~/demos/solutions/summer/summer.EXT

where EXT is c, cc, or java.

If you want to you can compute the growth g of any D
year period using the formulae

    double m = (double) P[YA+D] / P[YA];
    double g = 100 * ( exp ( log ( m ) / D ) - 1 );

Some output from running `make debug' on the judge's
solution using this formula is

Commentary
----------

Populations are estimated for European countries from
1820 on by Madison at

    www.ggdc.net/maddison/Historical_Statistics/
                          horizontal-file_02-2010.xls

and for other countries from 1950 on by the UN at

    esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Excel-Data/EXCEL_FILES/
      1_Population/
      WPP2012_POP_F01_1_TOTAL_POPULATION_BOTH_SEXES.XLS

It is actually not easy to define the start and stop
years of the demographic transition in a meaningful way.
The data needed to precisely define the start is gener-
ally unavailable.  Populations also grow as the food
supply grows (as happened when the amount of land under
cultivation grew in America), and may shrink as the
culture changes (as is happening now in Europe), so the
demographic transition is superimposed on a slower
long-term growth curve.

We have kept this problem simple even though the results
our solutions compute are not that close to the best
that can be computed.  The book

    A Concise History of World Population,
    by Massimo Livi-Bacci, English Translation, 2012

gives the following data (taken from a paper by J,-C.
Chesnais) on page 118:
