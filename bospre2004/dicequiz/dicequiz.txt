Dice Quiz
---- ----

You have become involved in writing software for a game
that is played with 6-sided dice.  A die is placed on
a board so that one of its faces is North, and the die
is then moved by rolling it to the North, East, South,
or West, so different faces are then on the top, bottom,
and sides.

A data base is needed to answer queries such as

  T1 N6 E?

which means, if 1 is on Top and 6 is to the North, what
digit is to the East?  Note that the order in which the
first two items are written does not matter, and

      N6 T1 E?

is the same query.

To make matters dicier, the die involved are non-stan-
dard.  They are described by lines such as

       D T1 B9 N4 E8 W3 S2

which says that in one of its positions, the die has
1 on top, 9 on the bottom, 4 to the North, 8 to the
East, 3 to the West, and 2 to the South.  Note that
the order of items (except for the D) does not matter,
so

	D E8 N4 W3 B9 S2 T1

describes the same die.  Also, a die has 24 possible
positions, and can be described in any one of these.



Input
-----

Lines each of which either describes a die or is a
query.  Each query is to be answered for the last die
described (the first line describes a die).  The faces
of the die can only have single digits, 0 through 9.
Two items in a line are separated by a single space,
and there are no spaces or tabs before the first item
or after the last.  Input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

The output is a exact copy of the input with each query
?  replaced with the face digit that is the answer to
the query.  In making the copy you can assume that the
`?' in each input query is the last character of the
query line.  You can also assume each query describes
a possible position of the current die.


Sample Input
------ -----

D T1 B9 N4 E8 W3 S2
T1 N3 E?
N3 T1 E?
D E8 N4 W3 B9 S2 T1
T1 N3 E?
N3 T1 E?
N3 T1 W?
N3 T1 S?
N3 T1 B?


Sample Output
------ ------

D T1 B9 N4 E8 W3 S2
T1 N3 E4
N3 T1 E4
D E8 N4 W3 B9 S2 T1
T1 N3 E4
N3 T1 E4
N3 T1 W2
N3 T1 S8
N3 T1 B9
