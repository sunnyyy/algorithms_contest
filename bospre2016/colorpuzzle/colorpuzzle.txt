Color Puzzle
----- ------

You have been asked to solve puzzles involving different
plastic creatures each with some color.

A typical puzzle is:

  if the mouse is blue or red, then the bear is red
  if the mouse is blue or green, then the hawk is red
  if the bear is green, then the squirrel is blue or red
  if the hawk is red, then the mouse is red
  if the squirrel is green, then the bear is green
  if the squirrel is blue, then the hawk is green
  if the squirrel is red, then the hawk is blue

The answer to this puzzle is:

  the mouse is red
  the bear is red
  the hawk is blue or green
  the squirrel is blue or red


Input
-----

For each of several test cases, first a test case name
line.  This is followed by statement lines, and at the
end of these, a line containing only `*'.

Statement lines have the form:

    if the C1 is COLORS1, then the C2 is COLORS2

where C1 and C2 name creatures and COLORS1 and COLORS2
are lists containing color names separated by `or'.

You may assume that only creatures mentioned in some
statement are given to you, there is only one of each
kind of creature, and each creature has a color
mentioned in some statement.  There are at most 8
creatures, 5 colors, and 100 statements in a test case.

Words are separated by whitespace or a comma (,) follow-
ed by whitespace.  All words contain only lower case
letters.  All lines are at most 80 columns long.

Input lines are read from the standard input.  Input
ends when an end of file is read.

Output
------

For each test case, first an exact copy of the test case
name input line, and then one creature description line
for each creature.  Each creature description line has
the form

    the C is COLORS

where C names the creature and COLORS is a list contain-
ing color names separated by `or'.  The creature
description lines may be in any order, and within one
of these lines, the colors may be in any order.

Notice that in the example there are two colorings that
are compatible with the statements:

			Coloring 1	Coloring 2

	mouse		red		red
	hawk		green		blue
	bear		red		red
	squirrel	blue		red

In `the C is COLORS' lines, a color must be listed if
and only if C can have the color in SOME compatible
coloring.  So both green and blue must be listed for the
hawk, and both blue and red must be listed for the
squirrel.

Output lines are printed to the standard output.  Output
ends when the program terminates.

At least one coloring is compatible with the statements
of each test case, so every creature description line
will have at least one color.
