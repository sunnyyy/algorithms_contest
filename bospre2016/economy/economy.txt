WhatWhat? Economy
-----------------

Congratulations!  You have been appointed the Economics
Minister of the fabulous country What?What?.  The
economy of What?What? is doing well, but the Parliament
and Prime Minister are demanding that you tell them
how much better it can be if everyone just produces
more and consumes more.

Luckily for you, your predecessor compiled precise
economic statistics before she left for the Asylum.
Also lucky is the fact that What?What? has a one item
economy.  The good citizens, in their never ending
quest for answers, decided some time ago that only
Calories mattered, and

  "A Calorie is a Calorie is a Calorie, be it from
   carrots or spinach or steak!"

So all the producers of What?What? produce Calories,
the transporters transport Calories (all equal by law,
regardless of weight or volume), and the consumers
consume Calories, heedless of where they come from.
Also the unit of money is the Calorie!

What?What? has a bunch of towns connected by roads.
Some towns have producers and some consumers and
some both and some neither.  Shipping is done by
specifying a route that is a sequence of links.

A link is a road between two towns plus the trucking
company that transports Calories over the road.  Each
link has a capacity that depends mostly upon the number
of What?What?iens who are willing to drive trucks over
the road.  There is a cost of transporting a Calorie
over a link, expressed as a small positive number in
units of Calories per Calorie.  If there is a link from
town X to town Y, there may or may not be a link from
town Y back to town X, and if there is, the capacities
and costs may differ.  However, there is at most one
link from any town X to any other town Y (the trucking
companies are possessive).

What you are to maximize is the sum of the Calories
produced minus the Calories spent on transport.  This
is called the GCP: Gross Calorie Product.

There is one more thing, however.  Some links are run by
Mafiosi who REQUIRE that a minimum number of Calories be
transported over their links.  Your predecessor found
that to keep the Mafiosi happy, it was occasionally
necessary to ship Calories in an aimless loop; though to
keep costs down this had to be minimized.


Input
-----

Input consists of one or more test cases.  Each test
case begins with a test case name line.  This is
followed by a line with the format:

	N M

where N is the number of towns and M the number of
links.  There follow N town description lines, each with
the format:

	producer-capacity consumer-capacity

which gives the maximum producer and consumer capacities
for a town.  The towns are indexed 1, 2, 3, ... N in the
order of their town description lines.

Then follow M link description lines, each with the
format:

	s d capacity cost minimum

which describes the link from town s to town d.  The
link has the given capacity in Calories, cost in
Calories per Calorie, and minimum number of Calories
that must be transported in order to satisfy the local
Mafiosi.

    2 <= N <= 20
    1 <= M <= 100
    0 <= producer-capacity <= 2,000
    0 <= consumer-capacity <= 1,000
    1 <= s,d <= N
    1 <= capacity <= 1,000
    0.01 <= cost <= 0.05
    0 <= minimum <= capacity
    S <= 1,000.00

where

    S = sum over all links of:
           (capacity - minimum) * cost

No two links have the same source and destination.  All
numbers are integers except cost which has 2 decimal
places.  Input ends with an end of file.  No input line
is longer than 80 characters.


Output
------

For each case, output one line containing exactly the
test case name, followed by one line containing either
the maximum GCP with exactly 2 decimal places, or
containing exactly the text:

	Mafiosi prevent solution!
