General GXMD's Tour
------- ------ ----

General GXMD, who lives in 5 dimensions, is responsible
for the home defense force in a sector of the galaxy
with N planets.  The planets are conveniently named
1, 2, 3, ..., N.  The general, who is on planet 1,
wants to make an inspection tour.  Specifically he wants
to go from planet 1 to planet N, stopping along the
way at every other planet, so he visits each planet only
once.  He wants you to find for him the shortest such
tour, in terms of 5 dimensional distance.


Input
-----

For each of several instances:

Line 1:  The number N of planets.  2 <= N <= 16.

Lines 2..N+1:  For each planet, one line containing
               the 5 coordinates of the planet.

The input ends with a line containing a single 0.


Output
------

For each instance, one line beginning with `Instance #:'
and followed by the numbers of the planets in the order
that the general is to visit them, so as to have the
shortest tour.  The first is always 1 and the last
always N.  Each planet number appears exactly once.
