What Wave?
---- -----

You are programming a sophisticated electronic device
repair robot, and it has to be able to figure out
whether the screen it is looking at is showing a
picture of a square wave or a sine wave, and what the
period of the wave is.

For example,

xx      xxxxxx      xxxxxx      xxxxxx      xxxxxx      
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
  xxxxxx      xxxxxx      xxxxxx      xxxxxx      xxxxxx

is a square wave with period 12 columns and

 xxx             xxx             xxx             xxx    
x   x           x   x           x   x           x   x   
     x         x     x         x     x         x     x  
                      x               x               x 
      x       x               x               x         
       x     x         x     x         x     x         x
        x   x           x   x           x   x           
         xxx             xxx             xxx            

is a sine wave with period 16 columns.


Input
-----

For each of several test cases, first a line containing
just the test case name, then several lines containing
the picture of the waveform, and then a line containing
just `*'.  At least two full cycles of the waveform are
pictured.

All lines are at most 80 columns long,  Picture lines
contain only single spaces and `x' characters.  All
picture lines are of the same length.  There are no more
than 20 lines in any picture.

Input lines are read from the standard input.  Input
ends when an end of file is read.


Output
------

For each test case, first an exact copy of the test case
name input line, and then one line containing first the
name of the wave type and second the period in columns.

The wave type name is either `sine' or `square'.  The
period must be accurate to + or - 1 column.

Output lines are printed to the standard output.  Output
ends when the program terminates.
