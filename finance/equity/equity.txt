Equity
------

You have been asked to write a program that will print
information that can be used to evaluate the financial
situation of a company.  The input is raw data about a
company for a sequence of years, and the output is an
income statement and balance sheet for the company for
each year.


Input
-----

The input is a set of lines each of which consists of
a data type character followed by a datum.  These are

N<company-name>
    All the data lines following, until the next N line
    or end of file, are for a company with the given
    name.  All data for one company is grouped together;
    any two different N lines are for different compan-
    ies.  An N line is always followed by a Y line.
Y<current-year>
    All the data lines following, until the next N or
    Y line or end of file, are for the given `current
    year'.  The Y lines for one company are sequentially
    increasing; that is, every Y line but the first for
    a given company contains a value one greater than
    the value of the previous Y line for the company.
S<sales>
    The sales (i.e. revenue) of the company in the
    current year.
R<received>
    The amount of money received from sales for the
    given year.  If you sell $1,000 worth and receive
    $900, then you are still owed $100, which is called
    a `receivable'.

O<operating-cost>
    The cost of operating the company during the current
    year.  This is the cost of manufacturing, adminis-
    tration, sales, advertising, etc. (but NOT the cost
    of capital expenditures, interest, dividends, or
    taxes).
P<paid>
    The amount of the operating cost you actually paid
    during the current year.  If your cost was $1,000
    and you paid $900, the you still owe $100, which is
    called a `payable'.  If instead you paid $1100, then
    presumably you had at least $100 of payables carried
    over from the previous year and paid off $100 of it.
C<capital-expenditures>
    Amount of money spent on capital (land purchases,
    construction, machinery, trucks, etc.) in the
    current year.
D<depreciation>
    The amount of capital that is to be charged against
    income in the current year.  If you pay $30,000 for
    a truck in 2003, rather than charge it all against
    income in 2003, you may charge $10,000 in each of
    the three years 2003, 2004, and 2005 as `deprecia-
    tion'.  If you pay $1,000 for land, however, you may
    never charge anything to depreciation, on the
    grounds that the land value does not depreciate.
I<interest>
    Interest paid on bonds in the current year.
T<taxes>
    Taxes paid in current year.
V<dividends>
    Dividends paid to stock holders in the current year.
E<new-equity>
    Amount taken in from venture capitalists or by sell-
    ing new shares of common stock, minus amount paid
    out to venture capitalists or to buy back the
    company's shares of common stock, for the current
    year.

B<new-debt>
    Amount of bonds sold minus amount of bonds retired
    during the current year.
G<inventory-change>
    Value of goods produced for sale minus value of
    goods sold during the current year.

More than one company is described in the input.  The N
value is a character string (all the characters after
the N until the end of line).  All the other values are
integers, which may be negative in some cases.  All the
integer values are in some unspecified unit, such as
millions of dollars or thousands of dollars, except of
course the years.  If any of the dollar values are not
given for a year, they are to be taken to be zero.
E.g., in the first year of a company, we might give only
Y, E, and C lines, and this means that all the other
dollar values are zero.

Input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

The output is an income statement and a balance sheet
for each company year for which data is provided in the
input.

The format of the output is as given in the Sample
Output.  All numbers are integers (you can think of them
as being in millions or thousands of dollars).  All
integers must be printed with their low order digit
exactly in column 40.  Only negative integers have a
sign, and no high order zeros may be printed.  Consecu-
tive words and years in the output must be separated by
a single space; and you may assume that this is true of
company names given in N lines.

Each non-blank output line starts in either column 1 or
column 3, and this indentation must be exactly as in the
Sample Output.  You can assume the N input line value is
well formatted, and you should just copy that line with
its initial `N' removed to an output line.

There should never be two blank lines in a row, and
blank lines must be included as indicated in the Sample
Output.  There MUST NOT be any blank line at the
beginning or end of output (be careful of this).

Note that failure to follow any of the spacing rules
will result in a `Formatting Error' score for your
program if everything else is correct.

In what follows, single capital letters such as S and I
mean `the S input line value' and `the I input line
value', etc.  The output is computed as follows:

`Income Statement' for a given company and year:

    Operating Revenue: S
    Operating Cost: O
    Depreciation: D
    Operating Income: Operating Revenue - Operating Cost
                                        - Depreciation.
    Interest: I
    Taxes: T
    Earnings: Operating Income - Interest - Taxes.
    Dividends: V
    Transfer to Equity:  Earnings - Dividends.

`Balance Sheet' for a given company and year:

    All these values are for the end of the current
    year.  These values are all set to zero before the
    first year of a company (i.e, by each N input line).

    Assets:
    Cash: Cash from previous year + R - P - C + E
        + B - I - T - V.
	Inventory: Inventory from previous year + G.
	Receivables: Receivables from previous year
		          + S - R.
			  Current Assets: Cash + Inventory + Receivables.
			  Fixed Assets:  The Fixed Assets from the pre-
			                 vious year + C - D.  (Essentially
					              the undepreciated capital).
						      Total Assets: Current Assets + Fixed Assets.

    Liabilities:
    Payables: Payables from previous year + O - P.
    Current Liabilities: Payables
    Debt: Debt from previous year + B.
    Total Liabilities: Current Liabilities + Debt.

    Equity: Total Assets - Total Liabilities.

You may find it helpful to program the following check
into your program as a debugging aid:

    Equity = Equity from the previous year
           + Transfer to Equity + E + G

Note that neither assets nor liabilities may be
negative, and among input values only E, B, and G may be
negative, but the income, earnings, transfer to equity,
and equity values can be negative.  Mathematically it
would be possible for an asset like cash to go negative,
but it would be an accounting error if this happened.

Remarks:
-------

The above comes mostly from `The Interpretation of
Financial Statements' by Benjamin Graham.  However the
above is an over-simplification, and there are also
terminological problems and accounting method disputes
that the author of this problem is not qualified to deal
with.

To take one example, a company with a good balance sheet
should have perhaps twice as much Current Assets, which
might be interpreted as assets that could be converted
into cash in a year, than Current Liabilities, which
might be interpreted as liabilities that must be paid in
a year.  Above we assumed that all bonds were long term
and none were current liabilities, but some modern
companies have taken to issuing lots of short term
(e.g., three month) bonds which should be listed as
Current Liabilities.

Even a real balance sheet is an over-simplification.
For example, some inventory may be unsellable and have
to be `written off' as a loss eventually, and similarly
some receivables may be uncollectible.  The networking
hardware companies leased much of their hardware to the
dot-com bubble companies and had to write off large
amounts of receivables when the dot-com bubble burst.
