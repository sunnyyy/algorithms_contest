Changing Point of View
-------- ----- -- ----
TeffalHead FatBody has stayed out too late on the planet
BadTrash and is in danger of being consumed by a Larger
BageGarLectorCol. To get to safety TeffalHead must get
to base A or base B or the ZoomTube that connects them.
He knows his own position, C, and the ZoomTube is a
perfectly straight line between A and B (woe betide a
zoomer in a curved ZoomTube). TeffalHead needs to know
immediately which he is closest to, A, B, or some point
on the ZoomTube between A and B.

TeffalHead knows the xy-coordinates of points A, B, and
C. Like any good robotminded soul, he expects to translate
and rotate the xy-coordinate system to make a new
x’y’-coordinate system in which A has x’y’-coordinates
(0,0) and B has x’y’-coordinates (L,0), where L is the
distance from A to B. Then the answer can be easily
read from the x’ coordinate of C.

Unfortunately, living up to his first name, which means
‘forgetful in emergencies’, TeffalHead has forgotten the
program that finds the x’y’-coordinate system. He as
put out a call for help, and as the only emergency proggrammer
within range, you must send him a program tout
de suite.

Note you are permitted to translate and rotate the
xy-coordinates, but NOT to reflect across a coordinate
axis. Unnecessary reflections are a terrible breech
of robot etiquette. Thus the y’ coordinate of C is
unambiguous.

Input
-----
For each of several cases, one line, containing

Ax Ay Bx By Cx Cy

where the xy-coordinates of points A, B, and C are respectively
(Ax,Ay), (Bx,By), and (Cx,Cy). Input ends
with an end of file.

Output
------
For each case one line containing:

(Cx’,Cy’) L ANS

where (Cx’,Cy’) are the x’y’-coordinates of C, L is
the length of AB, and ANS is one of the following:

A If TeffalHead is closest to A.
B If TeffalHead is closest to B.
ZoomTube If TeffalHead is closest to a point on the ZoomTube between A and B.

The x’y’-coordinates and L must be accurate to plus or minus 0.001.

Sample Input
------ -----
0 0 1 0 0.5 -6
5.0 3.0 5.5 2.5 5.0 4.0
5.0 3.0 5.5 2.5 5.0 1.0

Sample Output
------ ------
(0.500,-6.000) 1.000 ZoomTube
(-0.707,0.707) 0.707 A
(1.414,-1.414) 0.707 B
