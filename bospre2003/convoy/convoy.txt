The Safe and Speedy Driver Company makes robot drivers.
They have been asked to provide drivers for convoys of
trucks, but are unsure if their basic traveling algor-
ithm will work.  You have been asked to simulate it,
so see under what circumstances it will cause crashes.

The simulation is of N trucks traveling from right to
left.  In the beginning, all trucks are separated by
exactly L0 feet and are traveling a velocity V0 ft/s.
The simulation lasts for some number of seconds.

Each driver decides at the beginning of each second
whether to accelerate during the second, decelerate
(brake) during the second, or maintain velocity during
the second.  All acceleration is by A0 ft/s/s.  All
deceleration is by -A0 ft/s/s unless the current truck
velocity V ft/s is less than A0, in which case the de-
celeration is by -V ft/s/s so the truck velocity will be
0 at the end of the second.  Maintaining velocity, of
course, involves an acceleration of 0 ft/s/s during the
second.

During each second, the acceleration in ft/s/s of each
truck is constant, the velocity of the truck is a linear
function of time, and the distance traveled by the truck
is a quadratic function of time.

The algorithm each driver of a non-lead truck follows
to determine the truck's acceleration at the beginning
of a second is:

    if the truck is approaching the truck it is follow-
    ing at a relative velocity of at least dV ft/s, then
    decelerate

    else if the truck is receding from the truck it is
    following at a relative velocity of at least
    dV ft/s, then accelerate

    else if the truck is at least L0+dL ft from the
    truck it is following, accelerate

    else if the truck is at at most L0-dL ft from the
    truck it is following, decelerate

    else maintain speed

The lead truck receives instructions that tell its
driver what to do for each second.


Input
-----

For each of several cases,

    One line containing the numbers

    N L0 dL V0 dV A0

    One line containing the instructions for the lead
    driver.
    
The instructions are a sequence of +, 0, and - charac-
ters, one character per second.  Each is interpreted as
an instruction for the lead driver to

    +	       accelerate
    0	       maintain speed
    -	       decelerate

for one second.  The leftmost character is for the first
second, the rightmost for the last second, and the num-
ber of instruction characters is the number of seconds
in the simulation.  There are no spaces in the instruc-
tions line.

Simulations are limited to at most 100 seconds and at
most 11 trucks.  Input ends with an end of file.

Output
------

For each case

    One line containing just `Case #', where # is the
    number of the case, 1, 2, 3, etc, and there is
    exactly one space in the line.

    Lines containing the distances between the non-lead
    trucks and the truck they are following.  Each line
    contains N-1 distances, each in exactly 8 columns
    with exactly 3 decimal places.  Each distance is the
    distance between a truck and the truck it is follow-
    ing.  The distances are for the trucks from left to
    right: the first is for the truck after the lead
    truck.

    One line with the initial distances is printed,
    followed by one line for each second of simulation
    with the distances at the end of the second.

    If any output line has a negative distance, the
    simulation terminates, and a next line containing
    just `CRASH' is output.

Postscript
----------

Driving safety experts recommend drivers maintain a
at least 3 seconds separation between themselves and
the car in front of them in good weather.
