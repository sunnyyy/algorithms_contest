Binary Shuffle
------ -------

You've been hired by `Giants Gaming Emporium' to help
shuffle card decks, but, understand, `Giant's' is a
virtual gaming emporium.  So its all in a computer.

The process is simple: you have a (virtual) card deck
and you go to a (virtual) black box and press a
(virtual) button and out pops a binary number, which
instructs you on how to shuffle the deck.

Specifically, you read the bits from left to right, and
if a bit is 0 you take the next card from the BACK of
the deck, but if it is 1 you take the next card from the
FRONT of the deck.

So you can read the binary number `1001100' as

    front back back front front back back

and applied to the deck of 7 Tarot cards:

    21 - World
    20 - Angle
    19 - Sun
    18 - Moon
    17 - Star
    16 - Tower
    15 - Devil

gives the shuffled deck:

      21 - World
      15 - Devil
      16 - Tower
      20 - Angle
      19 - Sun
      17 - Star
      18 - Moon


Special Rules
------- -----

When you run out of cards, stop, even if there are more
binary digits.

If you run out of binary digits, go back to the BEGIN-
NING of the binary number.  Its as if you used an
unbounded number of copies of the binary number concate-
nated to each other.  E.g., `101' is equivalent to
`101101101...'.


Input 
-----

For each of several test cases, a line containing
just a test case name, followed by a line containing
the binary number, followed by up to 100 lines each
containing the name of one card, followed by a line
containing just `.'

Input ends with an end of file.

No line is longer than 80 characters.


Output
------

For each test case, a copy of the input except that
the order of the cards is their order AFTER the deck
has been shuffled.
