Spoonerisms
-----------

You have been asked to write a program that will produce
simple Spoonerisms.  The Reverend William Archibald
Spooner (1844-1930) was reputed to have the tendency to
switch consonants and vowels in words, and thus to turn
sentences like

	  You have missed all my history lectures.

into

	You have hissed all my mystery lectures.

Although the Reverend was prone to such slips of the
tongue, most `Spoonerisms' attributed to him were
actually made up by the Reverend's students and
colleagues for the fun of it.

You have been asked to write a program that will create
simple Spoonerisms by taking a sequence of words and
switching the consonant strings at the beginnings of
the first and last word.

Input
-----

For each of several test cases, one line containing
two or more words.  The words, which will consist solely
of lower case letters (for simplicity), are separated by
a single space character.  No other characters are on
the input line.  No line will be longer than 80
characters.

Input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

For each test case, a copy of the test case input line
with the consonant strings beginning the first and last
words switched (see samples below).  The longest strings
of consonants at the beginnings of the two words should
be switched.  A `y' should be treated as a consonant if
it begins a word, and as a vowel otherwise (this is also
for simplicity and is not a generally valid rule).  It
is possible that a string of consonants will be of zero
length.


Sample Input
------ -----

ease my tears
pack of lies
oiled bicycle
lighting a fire
dental receptionist
selling yaks
mystery house


Sample Output
------ ------

tease my ears
lack of pies
boiled icycle
fighting a lire
rental deceptionist
yelling saks
hystery mouse
