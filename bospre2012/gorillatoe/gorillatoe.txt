Gorilla Toe
------- ---

Gorilla Toe is a game just like Tic Tac Toe with the
following differences.  First, the game is played on
a board with N rows and M columns of squares, where
3 <= N,M <= 6.  Second, to win you must occupy min(N,M)
adjacent squares in a row or a column or a diagonal
(so on a board with 3 rows and 5 columns you must
occupy 3 adjacent squares in a row, a column, or a
diagonal).  Third, just before the game beings, a bunch
of gorillas rushes out and occupies some squares, where
they sit quietly during the rest of the game.  You
cannot occupy a square occupied by a gorilla - you just
will not fit!

You have been asked to write a player's assistant which,
when given a board state with P being the next player to
move, will label each unoccupied square according to the
fate of P if P moves next to that square and then both
players play optimally.

As in Tic Tac Toe, the players are X who moves first and
O who moves second.


Input
-----

For each of several test cases, first a line with the
test case name, then N lines of M columns, where N is
the number of rows and M the number of columns, and
then a single line containing just `.'.

The characters of the N lines of M columns describe the
state of the board, with one character for each square
containing:

	X	If the square is occupied by X.
	O	If the square is occupied by O.
	G	If the square is occupied by a gorilla.
	.	If the square is unoccupied.

No input line is longer than 80 characters.  Input ends
with an end of file.



Output
------

For each test case, an exact copy of the input, but with
the `.'s replaced by one of the following indicators of
what will happen if P moves to the `.'ed square and then
both players play optimally:

     W	     if P will win
     L	     if P will lose
     T	     if the game will tie
