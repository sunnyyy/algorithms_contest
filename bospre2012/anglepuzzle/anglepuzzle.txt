Angle Puzzle
----- ------
An angle puzzle consists of a finite set of vertices in
the plane and a set of equations of the form

xyz = some angle
or
xyz = ?

where x, y, and z are vertices and x != y != z != x.
xyz is interpreted as the angle at vertex y in the
triangle with vertices x, y, and z, if x, y, and z are
not all on the same infinite line, with this angle being
positive if traversing from x to y to z goes in the
counter-clockwise direction about the triangle, and
negative if clockwise.

But if x, y, and z are on the same infinite line, xyz =
0 if x and z are on the same side of y, and xyz = 180
if x and z are on opposite sides of y. These are useful
ways of saying that x, y, and z are on the same line.

Note that xyz = - zyx always and adding multiples of
360 to an angle does not change the angle (so 180 and
-180 are equal as angles). All input and output angles
are measured in degrees and are in the range (-180,180],
so +180 is allowed for input/output but -180 is NOT
allowed and must be replaced by +180.

The puzzle requires you to solve for the ?'s in the
the equations.

Sample 1 below is actually solvable using elementary
geometry without trigonometry, but in general you will
need to use trigonometry to solve these puzzles, as is
done in sample 2.

Input
-----

For each of several test cases, first a line with the
test case name, and then a sequence of lines with equations
as above, and then a line containing just '.'.

The vertex names are all single capital letters. The
angles are all in degrees. The only space characters
in any input line other than the test case name line
are the two surrounding the '='. No line is longer
than 80 characters.

No two vertices with different names are identical.
Input ends with an end of file.

Output
------

For each test case, a copy of the input but with ALL
'?'s replaced by numbers. All output angles should have
exactly 3 decimal places and be in the range
(-180,+180]. The output should be an exact copy of the
input except for the replacement of '?'s by the numbers
and the rounding of input angles to 3 decimal places.

This problem is actually open ended in that we do not
expect you to find all the angles that might be
determined from the given input. But you must find the
angles you are asked to find. These can be found by
using only non-trigonometric constraints on angles plus
trigonometrically computed relative positions of the
vertices of any triangle two of whose angles are known.
