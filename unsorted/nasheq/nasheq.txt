Nash Equilibrium
---- -----------

In Game Theory a simple finite two-person game consists
of
	two players
	a finite set of `strategies' for each player
	a payoff matrix for each player

Let the two players be R (`rows') and C (`columns').
Let the strategies for R be labeled 1, 2, ..., NR, and
the strategies for C be labeled 1, 2, ..., NC.  The
payoff matrix for R is R(r,c) where r is a strategy
for R and c a strategy for C; while the payoff matrix
for C is similarly C(r,c).  These matrices have integer
elements and larger payoffs are better.

A round of the game consists of each player privately
choosing a strategy, and then the two players
simultaneously announce their strategies.  Let r be
R's strategy and c be C's.  Then the round pays R the
amount R(r,c) and pays C the amount C(r,c).

You might think this simple minded, but it is an
abstraction that covers games such as TicTacToe.  For
TicTacToe a strategy will be some algorithm for
playing the game, and a round will consist of each
player choosing a strategy privately and the game being
played according to these strategies.  The payoffs might
be +1 for winning, -1 for losing, and 0 for tie.

The payoff matrices are commonly specified by a single
matrix whose elements are `R(r,c)/C(r,c)'.  Thus we have
the classic game:

		        Prisoner's Dilemma

		  1=Remain-Silent      2=Confess

1=Remain-Silent    -6/-6               -120/0

2=Confess	   0/-120               -60/-60

Two prisoner's are charge with a crime they committed.
If both remain silent, they each serve 6 months.  If
both confess, they each serve 60 months (5 years).  If
one confesses and the other remains silent, the confes-
sor goes free and the other prisoner serves 120 months
(10 years).

This game is symmetric: R(r,c) = C(c,r).  But not all
games are.

Given a game, a `dominated strategy' for R is an r such
that there exists an r' for which R(r',c) >= R(r,c)
for every c and R(r',c') > R(r,c') for some c'.  The
idea here is that r' is always a better strategy than
r, so r is `dominated' if and only if there is some
other strategy that is always better.  A dominated
strategy for C is defined analogously.

One way to decide how to game should be played is to
iteratively eliminate dominated strategies.  In the
case of Prisoner's Dilemma, Remaining Silent is a domi-
nated strategy for both prisoners, and eliminating it
gives a game in which both prisoners Confess.

Given a game, a `Nash Equilibrium' is a pair (r,c) such
that for every r', R(r,c) >= R(r',c) and for every c',
C(r,c) >= C(r,c').  The Prisoner's Dilemma has one Nash
Equilibrium: the pair where both players Confess.

Given a game you are asked to find all the dominated
strategies and all the Nash Equilibria.


Input
-----

The input consists of test cases.  Each test case begins
with a line containing the name of the test case.  This
is followed by a single line containing NR and NC in
that order, and this is followed by NR lines each
containing NC number pairs, where each pair is written
as `#/#' where # stands for an integer.  The c'th pair
of the r'th line is R(r,c)/C(r,c).

1 <= NR,NC <= 20.

Some of the input lines may be very long.

The input is terminated by an end of file.


Output
------

For each test case, four lines, the first being a copy
of the first test case input line that contains the
test case name.  The remaining three lines, in order,
are:

    Dominated R Strategies: r1 r2 ...
    Dominated C Strategies: c1 c2 ...
    Nash Equilibria: (r1',c1') (r2',c2') ...

where r1, r2, ..., c1, c2, ... are strategy numbers
(integers from 1 through NR and 1 through NC respec-
tively) and (r1',c1'), (r2',c2'), ... are strategy
pairs.

You must list ALL the dominated R and C strategies and
all the Nash Equilibria and not have duplicates, but the
order does not matter.  Its possible that there will be
nothing after a `:' on a line.  Some of the output lines
will be very long.
