Gaudy Artworks
--------------

You have been hired by Gaudy Artworks Inc. and are being
asked to help them manufacture one of their specialty
products.  This consists  of a white board in which a
number of circles are randomly placed.  Then a subset
of the circles which do NOT overlap each other too much
have their interiors colored various colors, while the
outlines of all the circles are overprinted in black.

Given a board with the circles placed randomly on it,
you have been asked to find a largest set of non-over-
lapping circles.

Your boss has defined overlapping as meaning that the
intersection of two circles has area greater than 0.5.


Input
-----

Input consists of one or more test cases.  Each test
case begins with a test case name line.  This is
followed by a line containing just N, the number of
circles.  2 <= N <= 40.

Then come N circle description lines, each of the format

	X Y R

where
	-1000 <= X, Y <= 1000
	5 <= R <= 100

Each line describes a circle of center (X,Y) and radius
R.

The circles are assigned indices 1, 2, 3, ..., N in
the order that their descriptions appear in the input.

Input ends with an end of file.  No input line is longer
than 80 characters.


Output
------

For each case, output one line containing exactly the
test case name, followed by one line containing the max-
imum number M of circles that have no overlap, followed
by the indices of M circles that have no overlap.  M
must be maximized.  There may be several solutions with
the same M; output only one.
