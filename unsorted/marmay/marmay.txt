Marriage Mayhem
-------- ------

Alex and Betty are soon to be married, but have each
forgotten a crucial item at home.  They must each
collect their item before the wedding may take place;
thus they wish to arrive there as soon as possible.
However, as tradition has it that the bride and groom
must not meet before the wedding, they must take care to
avoid running into each other.

Being decent people, their world consists of a graph.
The problem will specify Alex and Betty's start and
target vertices.  Traversing an edge will take one
second.  (It is also allowed to stand still at a
vertex.)  It is not allowed for Alex and Betty to:

-- be at the same vertex at the same time;
-- traverse the same edge at the same time.

Your job is to compute the earliest time at which both
Alex and Betty can be home, or to say that no solution
is possible.



Input
-----

For each test case, the input is:

Line 1:  5 integers: the number of vertices N;
         Alex's start vertex `as' and finish vertex
	 `af'; Betty's start vertex `bs' and finish
	 vertex `bf'; Vertices are numbered 1..N.
	 1 <= N <= 30.

Lines 2..N+1:
	 An nxn array of 0's and 1's, where 1's indicate
	 the presence of edges.  Each row is on a single
	 line.  The vertex numbers increase from left to
	 right and from top to bottom.  The matrix is
	 symmetric and the diagonal is all 1's.

Input will be terminated a line containing five 0's.



Output
------

A single line beginning with `Case #:'.  Then if a
solution is possible, this is followed by the integer
number of seconds the quickest solution takes; but if
no solution is possible, the word `impossible' is to
be output in place of an integer.



Sample Input
------ -----

3 1 3 3 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
3 1 3 3 1
1 1 0
1 1 1
0 1 1
0



Sample Output
------ ------

Case 1: 2
Case 2: impossible
