Slippery Redux, the Text Private Eye, is trying to set
up a system to catch text copycats.  To do this he needs
a program that will take input text and count the words
that match a pattern.  The patterns he is interested
in are fairly simple: they merely match the beginning of
each word to see if there is some sequence of vowels and
consonants and particular letters.  Thus the pattern
`CVC' matches all words beginning with a consonant
followed by a vowel followed by a consonant, and the
pattern `thV' matches all words beginning with the
letters `th' followed by a vowel.

The input has been preprocessed so it is just a sequence
of data words each of which contain nothing but lower
case letters.  The pattern is a word consisting of lower
case letters and the letters `C' and `V'.  In a pattern,
a lower case letter matches only the letter itself in a
data word, while `C' in a pattern matches any consonant
in a data word, and `V' in a pattern matches any vowel
in a data word.

The letter `y' in a data word is to be treated as both a
vowel and a consonant.  Thus BOTH `V' AND `C' ALWAYS
match `y'.


Input
-----

The input is a sequence of items, each of which is a
pattern, a data word, or the special item `*'.  Items
are separated by whitespace, which consists of one or
more spaces, tabs, or newlines.

The input contains one or more test cases, each consis-
ting of a pattern followed by 1 or more data words
followed by the item `*'.

Input ends with the item `*' by itself (where the next
pattern would be).

No data word or pattern is longer than 80 characters.


Output
------

For each test case, the single line

	Case #: #/# = #%

where the #'s denote numbers and are the following in
order: the test case number (chosen from 1, 2, 3, etc.),
the number of matching data words, the total number of
data words, and the ratio of matching to total data
words expressed as a percentage with exactly one decimal
place.


Sample Input
------ -----

thV
i like the best of the noise sometimes *
V
i like the best of the noise sometimes *
CVC
i like the best
of the noise sometimes *
CV
do you like my new nonsense *
*


Sample Output
------ ------

Case 1: 2/8 = 25.0%
Case 2: 2/8 = 25.0%
Case 3: 3/8 = 37.5%
Case 4: 6/6 = 100.0%
