Achieving Better Bias
--------- ------ ----

The Better Bias Bureau takes M faced biased dice with
known biases and makes from them N faced biased dice
with desired biases.  More specifically, if you have an
M faced biased die with probability pm[j] of throwing
face j, for j from 1 though M, but you really want
instead an N faced biased die with probability pn[i] of
throwing face i, for i from 1 through N, then good old
B3 will give you a method of achieving your desires.

The method is this.  You are to consider throwing your M
faced die an infinite number of times and writing out
the resulting faces, f1, f2, f3, ..., as an infinite
fraction .f1f2f3... base M.  The fraction will be a
number, call it F, in the range from 0 through 1.  For
any number r, 0 <= r <= 1, we can compute the probabil-
ity that F <= r.

Let rn[i] be defined so that

      probability F <= rn[i]
    = probability that an N faced die throw is k for
      some k <= i
    = sum of pn[k] for k from 1 through i

Then when you throw a value F with your M faced die, you
should declare it to be face i of the N faced die if

	          F < rn[i] if i = 1
or
	rn[i-1] < F < rn[i] if 1 < i < N
or
	rn[i-1] < F         if i = N
or

This method produces a properly biased N faced die.
Here one ignores the cases where F = rn[i] for some i,
as the probability of this happening is 0.

The neat thing about all this is that you do not actual-
ly have to throw the M faced die an infinite number of
times to decide what the value of i is.  After some
finite number of throws, depending on the value of F,
you can stop, knowing the answer i.

Suppose you stop as soon as possible.  What is the ex-
pected number of throws of the M faced die necessary to
produce one throw of the N faced die?


Note:
----

For technical reasons, relating to the elimination of
ambiguity in judging a contest, we use only one inequal-
ity if i = 1 or i = N.  To be a little more specific,
the judge's test data has been adjusted so that for all
cases that must actually be tested, either both the in-
equalities rn[i-1] < F and F < rn[i] will be true by a
margin definitely larger than the accuracy of the com-
putation, or one of these inequalities will be false by
a margin definitely larger than the accuracy of the com-
putation.  But it is NOT possible to adjust the judge's
data so the inequalities at the ends, rn[0] = 0.0 < F
and F < rn[N] = 1.0, will be true or false by a margin
definitely larger than the accuracy of the computation.
So we suppress these two inequalities, which we can do
without changing the validity of the method.


Input
-----

For each of several test cases:

  * M followed by pm[1], pm[2], ..., pm[M] in order.

  * N followed by pn[1], pn[2], ..., pn[N] in order.

Here 2 <= M <= 20, 2 <= N <= 20, and for all j and i
0.01 <= pm[j] <= 0.99, 0.01 <= pn[i] <= 0.99.  The sum
of all the pm[j] equals 1.0, and the sum of all pn[i]
equals 1.0.

Numbers are separated by whitespace, which may consist
of any sequence of spaces, tabs, or newlines.

Input ends with a line containing just a single 0.

You should use double precision floating point arithme-
tic to do input and computation, as more than 6 signifi-
cant figures of accuracy are necessary.


Output
------

For each test case, one line containing the expected
number of throws of the M sided die needed to generate
one throw of the N sided die.  This number should have
exactly 2 decimal places.


Sample Input
------ -----

2 0.5 0.5
4 0.1 0.2
  0.3 0.4
4 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4
2 0.5 0.5
2 0.5 0.5
3 0.333333333333 0.333333333333 0.333333333333
0


Sample Output
------ ------

3.50
1.45
3.00



Note
----

You might find it interesting to consider at your
leisure whether B3's method is optimal, i.e., achieves
the minimal expected number of throws of the M faced die
to generate one throw of the N faced die.
