3D Convex Hull
-- ------ ----

You are given a large number of points in 3-space and
must find the convex hull of these points.


Input
-----

For each test case, one line containing the name of the
test case, followed by a line containing just `n', the
number of points you are given, followed by n lines each
containing `x y z', the coordinates of one of the
points.  The points are numbered 1 through n in the
order that they appear in the input file.

The xyz coordinates are all integers in the range from
-1000 through +1000.  4 <= n <= 10,000.

The input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

For each test case, one line containing just the name
of the test case, followed by a line containing just
`m', the number of edges in the convex hull, followed by
m lines, each containing `i j', where i and j are the
numbers of the points that are the vertices of one of
these edges.  The input will be such that 4 <= m <= 100.
An edge, by definition, is the edge of a face of the
convex hull, and such a face can be any convex polygon.

To simplify the code, the input will be such that each
face is a triangle and all points on the convex hull
will be vertices of faces.  Thus no point will be in the
interior of a face or on the line between two other
points that are on the hull.

All the hull face edges must be output in SORTED order.
For an edge output as `i j', i < j is required.  Edges
with lower i values must be output first, and among
edges with the same i values, those with lower j values
must be output first.
