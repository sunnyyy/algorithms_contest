Penrose Tiling
------- ------

Sir Roger Penrose investigated aperiodic tilings of the
plane in the 1970's.  These tilings are generated
from a small number of finite shapes by following a set
of rules, but no translation of a tiling is identical to
the tiling, hence the designation `aperiodic'.

Penrose rhombus tilings are generated from a pair of
rhombi called `t', the `thin' rhombus, and `T', the
`thick' rhombus.  All sides of these are unit length.
The angles of t are 36 and 144 degrees, and those of T
are 72 and 108.

The sides of the rhombi also need to be labeled, so
we give the following algorithms for drawing them using
a pen:

  for t, thin rhombus:
    draw a straight line of unit length labeled +1
    turn left 1*36 = 36 degrees
    draw a straight line of unit length labeled -1
    turn left 4*36 = 144 degrees
    draw a straight line of unit length labeled +2
    turn left 1*36 = 36 degrees
    draw a straight line of unit length labeled -2
    turn left 4*36 = 144 degrees
    you are now back in your starting position

  for T, thick rhombus:
    draw a straight line of unit length labeled +1
    turn left 2*36 = 72 degrees
    draw a straight line of unit length labeled +2
    turn left 3*36 = 108 degrees
    draw a straight line of unit length labeled -2
    turn left 2*36 = 72 degrees
    draw a straight line of unit length labeled -1
    turn left 3*36 = 108 degrees
    you are now back in your starting position

The rhombi must be fit together so:

    1. The rhombi are rotated and/or translated but NOT
       flipped over.

    2. Two rhombi may not intersect.  This means that
       their intersection as sets, including boundaries,
       must not contain any points EXCEPT for those in
       shared vertices and shared edges.

    3. When an edge is shared between two rhombi, the
       sum of the two labels of the edge must be 0.
       E.g., a +2 edge from one rhombus may be shared
       with a -2 edge from another rhombus, but NOT with
       a +2 or -1 or +1 edge.

    4. There are no holes in the tiling.

In this problem you are given a proposed finite Penrose
rhombic tiling and you are asked to determine whether
it follows all the above rules.

We need a way to describe a finite Penrose rhombic
tiling.  We do this by placing the tiles down on the
xy-plane so that each tile but the first shares an edge
with one of the tiles laid down so far.

The first tile is always a T-tile with its +1 edge dir-
ected from (0,0) to (1,0) and its +2 edge directed from
(1,0) to (x,y) with x>1, y>0.  This is referred to as
the `standard position' for the first tile, which is
also tile 1 in a our tile labeling scheme that numbers
the n tiles laid down so far from 1 through n.

The position of the n+1'st tile is given by the line

	k j e

where

	k is the kind of tile, either `t' or `T'
	j is the number of a previous tile that is to
	  share an edge with the new tile; 1 <= j <= n
	e is the label (+1, -1, +2, or -2) of the edge
	  of tile j that is to be shared with the new
	  tile, respecting the rule about the sum of
	  shared edge labels being zero

Thus the line `t 7 -2' says to lay a t-tile so that its
+2 edge is shared with the -2 edge of the 7'th tile
laid.



Input
-----

The input consists of test cases.  Each test case begins
with a line containing the name of the test case.  This
is followed by any number of lines each containing a
description `k j e' of another tile to be laid to make a
tiling pattern.  The first tile of the pattern is in
standard position, and the i'th line of the form `k j e'
describes how to lay the i+1'st tile.  After these lines
there is a line containing just `.', which is the last
line of the test case.

	maximum number of tiles <= 10,000

	for each tile vertex (x,y):
	    -100 <= x <= +100
	    -100 <= y <= +100


Output
------

For each test case, first output an exact copy of the
test case name line, and then output just one line in
one of the following formats:

	tile # intersects tile #
	tile # edge # is shared with tile # edge #
	there are # holes
	tiling OK

Here the #'s are integers that are tile labels, edge
labels, or counts.  The first line is output if two
tiles intersect; the second if two share edges have
labels not summing to 0.  If the tiling violates the
rule against intersection AND the rule against edge
labels not summing to 0, then either of the first two
lines may be output -- only one violation is to be
reported.

However, reporting holes must ONLY be done if there are
NO intersection or edge label sum violations.


Printing Input
-------- -----

As a debugging aid, the command

	print_penrosetiling foo.in

will print a picture of the tiling described in foo.in.
The file sample_input.ps contains the result for the
sample input.

The labels in the picture are represented by single
arrows (+1, -1) or double arrows (+2, -2) going around
the rhombus boundary in the counter-clockwise (+1, +2)
or clockwise (-1, -2) directions.  They are offset so
that usually if a shared edge has labels not summing to
zero this will be visible in the picture.  But their
are perverse cases; consider:

	-- PERVERSE CASE --
	t 1 +1
	T 2 -1
	.


Sample Input
------ -----

This is available in the file sample_input.in.


Sample Output
------ ------

-- PENROSE TILING SAMPLE 1 --
tiling OK
-- PENROSE TILING SAMPLE 2 --
tile 1 and tile 7 intersect
