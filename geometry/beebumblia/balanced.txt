Balanced Strings
-------- -------

A balanced string is a string whose parentheses all
match.  Thus

     balanced-string
         ::= empty-string
	   | balanced-string non-parenthesis-character
	   | balanced-string ( balanced-string )

You have been asked to develop a piece of code that
determines whether strings are balanced.

Sample Input
------ -----

But this is (a) bit (un((bal)(en(ce)d)).
And so is) (this).


Note: This sample input is a file with exactly 3 lines.


Sample Output
------ ------

String 1: balanced
String 2: NOT balanced
String 3: NOT balanced
