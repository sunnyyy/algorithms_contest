Reflect
-------

Every isometry of N-dimensional space can be represented
as the composition of at most N+1 reflections.  You are
given isometries, and must find representations of each
as a composition of at most N+1 reflections.

You are given isometries in the form

    v |---> T + Mv

where v and T are N-vectors and M is an NxN orthogonal
matrix.

You must output equivalent representations of the form

    v |---> R[1]R[2]R[3]...R[K]v

where R[i] is a reflection across the hyperplane

      { v : U[i].v = C[i] },

U[i] is a unit vector, C[i] a real number, and U[i].v is
the scalar product of U[i] and v, so that R[i] is char-
acterized by U[i] and C[i].  It is required that K <=
N+1 and that C[i] not be too large.

An isometry may have many different equivalent represen-
tations as such compositions of reflections, and you are
being asked to output just one.
      


Input 
-----

For each of several test cases, a line containing just
the test case name, followed by a line containing

    N T[1] T[2] ... T[N]

where T = (T[1], T[2], ..., T[N]) is the translation
vector, followed by N lines containing M in the
format

    M[1,1] M[1,2] ... M[1,N]
    M[2,1] M[2,2] ... M[2,N]
    ........................
    M[N,1] M[N,2] ... M[N,N]

The isometry is

    (T+Mv)[i] = T[i] + sum over j of M[i,j]*v[j]

or in other words, vectors are to be viewed as column
vectors.

N is an integer, and the other numbers are floating
point.  2 <= N <= 20.  T[.] has an absolute value not
greater than 10.  Because M is an orthogonal matrix,
M[.,.] cannot have an absolute value greater than 1.
The test case name line is not longer than 80 charac-
ters, but other lines may be longer.  Input ends with
an end of file.


Output
------

For each test case, first an exact copy of the test case
name line, then a line containing just K, and then K
lines, the i'th representing R[i], of the form

       C[i] U[i][1] U[i][2] ... U[i][N]

In this line each number should take exactly 10 columns
and have exactly 6 decimal places.  U[i] must be a unit
vector and the absolute value of C[i] must not be
greater than 10*N.

The equivalence required is

    R[1]R[2]...R[K]v = T + Mv

The judge will check that this equation holds to 3 deci-
mal places for v equal to each of the N+1 points:

    (0,0,...,0)	 [Origin]
    (1,0,...,0)	 [N Unit Vectors]
    (0,1,...,0)
    ..........
    (0,0,...,1)

Here the judge is using the fact that if two isometries
agree on N+1 points, and the points span an N-dimension-
al affine subspace, the two isometries are identical on
that subspace.  This in turn follows from the fact that
any point P on the straight line through two distinct
points P1 and P2 is uniquely determined by its distances
from P1 and P2.

Solutions are not unique, you are to output any one.
You are NOT required to find a solution with a minimum
number of reflections.
