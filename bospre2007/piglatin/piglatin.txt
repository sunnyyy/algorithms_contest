Pig Latin
---------

You have been asked to translate English words to Pig
Latin.  The translation is very simple: take all the
consonants at the beginning of the word, move them to
the end, and add `ay'.  If there are no consonants at
the beginning of the word, just add `ay' to the end.
The consonants are all letters except `a', `e', `i',
`o', `u', and `y'.   Note that `y' is NOT a consonant
for our purposes.


Input
-----

A sequence of lines each containing an English word.
There are no spaces in any line.  Words will contain
only lower case letters.

The input ends with an end of file.

Output
------

For each English word, one line containing nothing but
the translation of the word into Pig Latin.

Example Input
------- -----

you
help
me
to
understand
pig
latin
this
hour


Example Output
------- ------

youay
elphay
emay
otay
understanday
igpay
atinlay
isthay
ourhay


Note: Actual Pig Latin moves only initial consonant
SOUNDS, and therefore does not move unsounded initial
consonants.  Thus `hour' would become `houray' in
actual Pig Latin.  There are also variants which put
`way' or `yay' or some such at the end of words that
begin with a vowel sound.
