American SOUNDEX
----------------

SOUNDEX is a system of translating words into crude
phonetic approximations that may be used to suggest
spellings for misspelled words.  For example, `Tymczak'
and `Timsack' both translate to `T522', and so if a
writer writes `Timsack' and that is not in the
dictionary, but `Tymczak' is, a spell checker can
suggest `Tymczak' as a possible correct spelling.

The SOUNDEX rules for translating a word are as follows:

(1) Apply a translation table to translate every
    character to a digit, -, or *.
(2) Delete all occurrences of *.
(3) Delete any digit that follows an identical digit.
    (Alternatively, replace any string of identical
    digits by a single digit.)
(4) Delete all occurrences of -.
(5) If the first letter of the original word translated
    to a digit, replace that digit, which now begins
    the translated word, by the letter; otherwise pre-
    pend the letter to the translated word (prepend is
    to `beginning' as append is to `end').
(6) The translated word now consists of a letter
    followed by zero or more digits.  Discard all digits
    but the first three.  If there are less than 3
    digits, append `0's until there are 3 digits.

The translation table used for American English is

    a, e, i, o, u, and y each translate to -
    h and w each translate to *
    b, f, p, and v each translate to 1
    c, g, j, k, q, s, x, and z each translate to 2
    d and t each translate to 3
    l translates to 4
    m and n each translate to 5
    r translates to 6

If you study these rules, you will find that sequences
of similar consonants are translated to a single digit
unless they are separated by vowels, vowels are other-
wise ignored, and `h' and `w' are completely ignored.
In addition, the first character is kept, and only the
first three dissimilar or vowel separated consonant
sequences are kept.


Input 
-----

For each of several test cases, one line containing just
the word to be translated.  To keep things simple, each
word contains only lower case letters and has at most
25 letters.

Input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

For each test case, one line of the form

    WORD-TO-BE-TRANSLATED => TRANSLATED-WORD


Sample Input
------ -----

robert
rupert
rubin
ashcraft
ashcroft
tymczak
timsack
pfister
how

Sample Output
------ ------

robert => r163
rupert => r163
rubin => r150
ashcraft => a261
ashcroft => a261
tymczak => t522
timsack => t522
pfister => p236
how => h000

Tips:
----

Input consists of lines read from the standard input.
Input ends when an end-of-file is read from the standard
input.  Output consists of lines written to the standard
output.  For example input/output code see

    ~/demos/solutions/reverser/reverser.EXT

where EXT is c, cc, or java.

You may find it beneficial to add code so that if your
program is being run in debug mode it outputs

    WORD => TWORD1 => TWORD2 => ... => TWORD6

where WORD is the original word, TWORD1 the word after
the first translation step, TWORD2 the word after the
second step, and TWORD6 the word after the 6'th and
final step.  Some examples from `make debug' using the
judge's solution are

robert => 6-1-63 => 6-1-63 => 6-1-63 => 6163
    => r163 => r163
rubin => 6-1-5 => 6-1-5 => 6-1-5 => 615
    => r15 => r150
ashcraft => -2*26-13 => -226-13 => -26-13 => 2613
    => a2613 => a261
tymczak => 3-522-2 => 3-522-2 => 3-52-2 => 3522
    => t522 => t522
pfister => 11-23-6 => 11-23-6 => 1-23-6 => 1236
    => p236 => p236
how => *-* => - => - => 
    => h => h000

where we added some extra line feeds to conform to this
current document's 56 column width limit.
