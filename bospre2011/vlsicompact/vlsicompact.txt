VLSI Compaction
---- ----------

When laying out a VLSI circuit, the following problem
arises after the circuit has been initially laid out.
The problem is to squish the circuit into a minimum
area.  It is too difficult to do this in more than one
dimension, but not hard to do it in a single dimension.

Abstractly the problem is as follows.  Given a set of
N horizontal coordinate values x[i] (actually the hori-
zontal coordinates of VLSI transistors and larger `com-
ponents'), and a set of constraints of the form

	   0 <= d[i,j] <= x[j] - x[i]   where j > i

find positions x[i] such that x[i] - x[1] is minimized.
Here the value index i in x[i] ranges from 1 through N
and there is one constraint for every i and j for
which j > i, though d[i,j] = 0 will be true for many
of these.


Input
-----

For each of several test cases, first a line containing
just the test case name.  This is followed by one or
more lines containing the following non-negative integer
numbers:

        N d[1,2] d[1,3] d[1,4] ... d[1,N]
                 d[2,3] d[2,4] ... d[2,N]
                        d[3,4] ... d[3,N]
                               ..........
                               ... d[N-1,N]

The integers are in the given order, but any kind of
whitespace (spaces, tabs, line breaks) may occur between
any two consecutive integers.

2 <= N <= 100

Input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

For each test case two lines.  The first line is an
exact copy of the test case name input line.  The second
line contains the integers

     x[1] x[2] ... x[N]

in the given order, such that x[i] - x[1] is minimized
for i = 2, 3, ..., N.

x[1] = 0 is required (otherwise the numbers would be
under-determined).
