Problem 6: Electric Cars

The availability of charging stations is a factor that needs to be considered
when planning a trip in an electric car. In this problem, compute the minimum
trip distance between two points.

A graph which represents a road network will be provided, you may assume that
a charging station is at each node. What is the length of the shortest path
between two nodes, taking into account the range restriction of the car?

Input
-----
1. A non-negative integer describing the range of the car.
2. The program should exit if the range is zero.
3. A comma-separated list of the nodes. Each node is described by a single
   uppercase letter.
4. The next line has a positive integer describing how many edges are in the
   graph.
5. Each edge is described by a comma-separated list of the two vertices, and
   the distance. Edges are bi-directional.
6. After the edges, comma-separated pairs of edges denote potential trips.
7. Queries about this graph will be terminated by a period ('.') on a line by
   itself.
8. The program should continue accepting graphs and queries until the range
   of the car is 0.

Output
------
1. The program should output the shortest distance of the path that a car with
   that range can take to get between the two points.
2. If there is no path possible for that car, then the program should output
   -1.
