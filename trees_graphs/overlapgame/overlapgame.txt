The Overlap Game
----------------

The Overlap Game is played with a set of words that are
used to create a string of letters.  The first player
picks a word from the set and puts it on the board,
creating the string.  Thereafter each player picks a
word and puts it at the end of the string, BUT, the
beginning of the word must overlap the end of the string
by one or more letters.  The word is placed so its over-
lapping letters actually overlap those at the end of the
string.  Each move must increase the number of letters
on the board.

Thus if a game starts with the words

     THE  EATEN	      ENCHANTMENT

the first move could result in

    THE

the second move could result in

    THEATEN

and the third move could result in

    THEATENCHANTMENT

However, a second move resulting in

	 THENCHANTMENT

is also possible, and then there could be no third move.

There are only two players in this game, and the person
to move last loses.  Play stops only when no more words
can be added to the string.

You have been asked to assist a player by determining
winning moves.



Input
-----

For each case, a list of words followed by the mark `*'.
The words and marks are separated by whitespace, where
any combination of spaces, tabs, and line ends are
considered to be whitespace.

All words consist of just upper case letters.  There are
at most 100 words in a case, and each word is at most
20 letters.

An end of file terminates the input.


Output
------

For each case, a single line containing just the (upper
case) words the first player can play first to force a
win.  The words are separated by spaces.

If there are no words that will result in a win, the
single line should instead contain just lower case
`lose'.  This indicates the first player must lose if
the second player plays optimally.
